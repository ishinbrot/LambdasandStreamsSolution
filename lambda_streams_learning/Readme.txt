Part 2:
Now that you have identified which professor corresponds is teaching which students using java streams, it is time to add lambda's and sort each class by a students last name.
Every professor contains a list of students, along with their respective class list

Every class the professor teaches is graded on either a pass/fail, but affects the students GPA differently.
Each professor has a specifc grade in their class. That is the grade they will automatically give every student upon completing.
Use the grades to update each students new GPA. Utilize Java Streams and Lambda functions.


Every professor is assigned a grade, and has given each student their respective grade. All of the students have had their total number of grade points added up.
They do not yet have their GPA. In order to compute their GPA you need to divide their grade by the number of classes they are taking

After you are done sort all of the students by their first name and print out the output using java streams in one line
Use the updated Java 8 interface for sorting the list using a comparator lambda function to return a new stream.
Please use collect afterwards to construct a new list from the sorted list
